<h1>Doubly Invisible</h1>
<h2>The struggles of being LGBT and Asian</h2>
</div>

<div class="container" id="LGBTarticle">
<h3>By Victoria Cabales</h3>

<p>As a conservative Southern Baptist minister, Pastor Danilo “Danny” Cortez never imagined that 60 percent of his congregation would one day leave his church due to his involvement with the LGBT community. Prior to becoming an LGBT activist to advance the rights of his gay son, the Filipino pastor firmly believed that homosexuality was a sin.</p>

<p>“We tried to pray the gay away,” Cortez told a small audience at a family acceptance workshop for LGBT Asian-Americans. “We tried to change people. We even had a fund to send them to therapy.” </p>

<p><b>From praying the gay away to becoming an LGBT activist</b></p>

<p>Cortez’s former views represent the typical attitudes of Christian, Asian families toward homosexuality. Conservative standards pushing for straight, traditional families often strain the relationships between Asian parents and their LGBT children. However, the pastor of the New Heart Community Church in the Los Angeles area said he changed his views after personally getting to know some of the LGBT members of his congregation. </p>

<p>Finally, when his son, Drew, came out to him, Cortez wholeheartedly accepted his sexuality and even risked losing his job as a pastor to support him. </p>

<p>“If I had a pill that could change you and take away your gayness, I wouldn’t give it to you,” Cortez said he told his son. “You’re beautiful. God made you the way you are. You’re perfect.” </p>

<p>Today, Cortez works with the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance, or NQAPIA, to help Asian parents overcome the difficulty of accepting their queer children. He recently shared his story at a family acceptance workshop hosted by local Asian pride organizations in Chicago on May 22. These organizations include Invisible 2 Invincible: Asian Pacific Islander Pride of Chicago, or i2i, and Trikone Chicago, the latter of which supports queer South Asians. </p>

<p>“As a pastor who advocated against you for so long, I want to say to you that I’m sorry,” Cortez told his audience at the event. “I’m sorry for making you feel less than human.”</p>

<p><b>LGBT Asian-Americans face discrimination within both Asian and LGBT communities</b></p>

<p>Other LGBT Asian-Americans, however, have not encountered the same sentiments of acceptance and apology within their communities. In a 2007 study conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, over half of the respondents reported that homophobia and transphobia are problems within the Asian and Pacific Islander community. In the same study, nearly four out of five respondents agreed that LGBT Asian-Americans face racism within the white LGBT community. Because of this combination of racial, sexual and gender discrimination, 98 percent of the survey’s respondents have experienced discrimination in some way.</p>

<p>“In LGBT communities, I am faced with racism, and in Asian communities, I am faced with homophobia, mostly by Christianity,” Sungsub “Billy” Cho, a gay Korean international student pursuing his master’s degree in psychological counseling at Columbia University, said.</p>

<p>Cho also said that LGBT rights are often viewed as a “white person’s issue” because of the language barriers between parents and their children. In many Asian languages, words like “gay” and “transgender” do not exist, causing further tension within families. As a result, it is sometimes more difficult to discuss sexuality within Asian communities, occasionally taking a toll on an individual’s mental health.</p>  

<p>“I had a bout of suicidality when I was coming out to my parents and they did not accept me,” Cho said. He asked himself, “Why am I even alive when my parents do not accept me for who I am?”</p>

<p><b>Cultural stress contributes to mental health issues</b></p>

<p>Cho is not alone in his struggle with mental health due to cultural stress. A study published in the 2004 version of the “Journal of Homosexuality” found that some LGBT Asians “endure considerable and constant psychological stress” in keeping their sexuality a secret from family members and friends. Especially within East Asian countries, strong Confucian beliefs push for the idea that a person is a representative of one’s family, rather than an individual.</p>

<p>These strong family ties often compel Asian parents to deny the LGBT identity of their children. As a result, the racial, sexual and gender identities of LGBT Asian-Americans may sometimes seem irreconcilable to their families.</p>

<p>“I felt ashamed,” Marsha Aizumi, mother of a transgender Japanese-American man, said at a family acceptance workshop hosted by NQAPIA. “From my Asian culture, I was told that I could never bring dishonor to my family. I felt that when Aiden came out as lesbian, and then transgender, and transitioned to being my son, I felt like I was bringing dishonor to my family.”</p>

<p>NQAPIA works to address the stress caused by cultural differences by releasing public service announcements of Asian parents accepting the LGBT identity of their children. In these commercials, parents declare in their native languages that they love their children regardless of their sexual and gender identities. Airing in languages ranging from Hindi to Vietnamese, these commercials represent the diversity of the LGBT Asian-American community and reach out to parents who would not be able to understand their children’s identities otherwise.</p>

<p>These commercials work to address the concern LGBT Asian-Americans have toward American media. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported that 38 percent of LGBT Asian-Americans surveyed believe that media representations are the most important issue facing their community. Many of these individuals believe that LGBT representation is dominated by gay, upper-class, white men.  </p>

<p>“Asian-Americans are the nation’s fastest growing minority group,” Glenn Magpantay, executive director of NQAPIA, said. “We are the largest segment of immigrants in the United States, both legal and undocumented, and yet the face of the LGBT community does not represent the diversity of our community. So many times we’ve heard the stories of the moms who say, ‘I love my gay son. I love my trans child,’ and it’s beautiful. But they’re all white.”</p>

<p>In addition, due to the lack of representation, many Asian-Americans feel that the media perpetuates unhealthy stereotypes about their race. Such stereotypes cause further conflict between the Asian-American and LGBT communities, as Asians are labelled as high-achieving and sexually submissive.</p>

<p><b>Media representations perpetuate stereotypes against Asian-Americans</b></p>

<p>“A lot of our Asian culture is very patriarchal,” Esther Fan, co-creator of Sad Asian Girls Club, an art collective made to combat stereotypes about Asian women, said. “If you’re a woman, you’re expected that you’ll marry a man, and you’ll be a good wife. All your achievements are meant to serve who you’ll be marrying in the future.”</p>

<div class="caption-container"><p class="caption">In a three-part video series, Esther Fan and Olivia Park interviewed Asian women about their opinions on the model minority myth, revealing the harmful stereotypes associated with it (<a href="http://www.sadcontent.com/work/#model-minority-series">sadcontent.com</a>).</p></div>

<p>Currently a junior at the Rhode Island School of Design, Fan and her friend, Olivia Park, use art to combat institutionalized and societal oppression forced on Asian women. Their projects within Sad Asian Girls Club include videos that portray the rigid expectations their parents have for them concerning how they should look and act. While Fan comes from a Taiwanese household, and Park is of Korean descent, their work represents the shared experience of many Asian-American women in the face of conservative standards. Many of the stereotypes placed on Asian-American women regarding passivity and submission are perpetuated from the way they were raised, the girls said.</p>

<p>Asian-American women are often fetishized as good wives, and many Asian-American families simply assume that their children are cisgender and heterosexual, Fan said.</p>

<p>Di Xiao, a School of Communications sophomore at Northwestern University, said that gay Asian men are also affected by this stereotype of passivity. Originally from Beijing, he said he believes that Asian men are usually stereotyped as asexual, submissive, quiet and shy. </p>

<p>“Asian women are so popular among white guys because of the submissiveness [that makes them] good wives, good romantic partners,” Xiao said. “That kind of dynamic applies to gay Asian men and gay white men.”</p>

<p>As a result of this stereotype, gay Asian men said they often feel desexualized by the media, Michael Meng, a sophomore at the University of Chicago studying economics and public policy, said. </p>

<p>Asian-American men are often depicted as nerds, Meng said. “Very rarely on the screen do you see an Asian-American man on a date or in a relationship.”</p>

<p>These unhealthy stereotypes perpetuate further discrimination against LGBT Asian-Americans and allow for their queerness to be denied, both within and outside of their racial communities. Combined with public underrepresentation and rigid cultural values, LGBT Asian-Americans live in a state of double stigmatization, in which they must combat both racist and heteronormative assumptions. </p>

<p>Although the attitudes of Asian-American attitudes toward LGBT individuals are often characterized by silence, or even denial of the individual’s identity, many families have overcome the difficulty of accepting both marginalized identities. </p>

<p><b>Move towards acceptance in the face of strict cultural expectations</b></p>

<p>Meng’s parents, for example, originally did not accept his LGBT identity when he came out as gay during his freshman year of college. After his parents’ initial denial of his homosexuality, Meng ran approximately 100 miles away from home. His parents eventually found him by using the GPS tracker on his iPhone, and they opened up to understanding hi sexuality for the first time.</p>

<p>Today, Meng feels that his relationship with his parents is better than it was before coming out. </p>

<p>“Over time, we’ve built up a lot of understanding, and I think I’m closer to my parents now than I ever was when I was growing up,” Meng said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”</p><br />

<h3>By Victoria Cabales</h3>

Few would expect Northwestern University graduates to devote their professional lives to the culinary arts as chefs. However, Sean Quan and Jenny Phan defy traditional expectations. Quan moved away from his aspirations of becoming a lawyer to work as the chef de partie of Everest, an elegant French restaurant located on the 40th floor of the Chicago Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Phan, entered the food industry as a marketing specialist and photographer for Northwestern Dining. 

“Two years ago, I didn’t even know how to cook scrambled eggs,” Quan said. “And here I am, working at a Michelin star restaurant in the city.”

Quan’s love for cooking began simply from teaching himself how to make basic meals at his first apartment. From then on, he decided to hone his culinary skills by learning from professional chefs. After taking the bold move of calling several renowned Chicago restaurants, Quan landed the opportunity to enter the world of fine dining by staging at Everest. Staging, a culinary term, refers to a brief, unpaid chef’s internship.

Afterwards, Quan, Phan, and another Northwestern student, Yang Xu, brought their culinary passions to their school community by founding the club Cookology. While simultaneously cramming for exams and inventing new recipes, Quan and Phan brought firsthand restaurant experience to fellow students by organizing small-scale, one-day restaurants known as pop-ups.

Phan said that she found her passion for cooking by applying her artistic background to create new flavor profiles for Cookology events.

“For me, it really started in Cookology,” she said. “We first started planning out the process when we were juniors.”

Drawn in by how Cookology’s pop-ups spurred other students’ interest in food, Quan and Phan have continued to host pop-up restaurants after graduating. The couple graduated from Northwestern in June 2015. Quan earned his bachelor’s in philosophy and psychology with a legal studies minor. Meanwhile, Phan earned her degree in psychology with minors in cognitive science and legal studies.

Their current project, Tandem, consists of a series of intimate, gourmet dinners. During these dinners, Quan and Phan try to engage customers by teaching them about how various aspects of the dishes were made. Tandem emphasizes the idea of togetherness, especially since diners and chefs never really interact with each other in most restaurant settings, Phan said.  

“We want to create an environment where people feel welcome,” the couple said. “The thing I’ve hated about fine dining is that it’s so inaccessible,” Quan added.

The most recent Tandem dinner, known as Beginnings, took place on April 24 and emphasized the theme of unity. One of the dishes, Exploration, presented various herb garnishes on lotus root plates to educate guests about the ingredients that were used. 

Phan said that one of the biggest differences between Tandem and Cookology’s pop-ups is the emphasis on the customer’s experience. While they accounted for the experience of the student chefs during Cookology pop-ups, Phan said that they can focus more on how customers critique their food through Tandem.”

“[With Cookology, you] have to think about how to make this enjoyable and fun and satisfying, not just for the people that are paying to come and eat there, but also for the people that are going to come and help you,” Quan said.

Today, Northwestern freshmen Huy Do and Cheryl Chen carry on the club that Quan and Phan started. The two club co-presidents plan on continuing the club’s pop-up restaurants throughout the year, drawing inspiration from Quan and Phan’s example. 

“When we’re testing for the pop-up, it goes until 3 a.m. in the morning,” Chen said. “Personally, I think it’s really inspiring and really unique that someone with ordinary majors went into the culinary world.”

Cookology’s next pop-up, Drift, will take place on Saturday, May 28. Drift will carry on the founders’ idea of an educational dining experience by teaching customers about international dishes. 

Do hopes to carry on Cookology’s “legacy built on a lot of hard work and sacrifices” by emphasizing the importance of bringing the community together through the experience. Quan said that the original mission of Cookology was simply to bring people together through their shared need for food.

“I kind of think food is the universal language,” Quan said. “Food is a vehicle for interaction with someone else that you might not have otherwise cared about.”

    <p>I'm a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Journalism and Computer Science. I like to write, code, and explore new places. Always looking to explore something fun and challenging, I'm interested in experimenting with the ways technology can influence journalism. 
    <br />
    <br />
    When I'm not working on a new project, you can find me cooking, training for my next marathon, or hopping from one coffee shop to the next.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>I'm passionate about finding ways to tell creative stories through code. I've gained experience in interface design, virtual reality, and software engineering. I also plan on exploring computational photography and data visualization in the near future. My ideal career involves creating interactive and immersive journalistic experiences through online platforms.</p>

        <h4 class="media-heading">SceneVR</h4>
          SceneVR is a virtual reality tool that provides immersive journalistic experiences that can be embedded into online platforms without additional support. The tool renders 3D panoramas in sequential stories that are supported on desktop, mobile, and Google Cardboard. Collaborating with a four-person team through Northwestern University's Knight Lab, I helped design this product by drafting its interface on PhotoShop, researching ways to render text in 3D spaces, and gathering user feedback through testing.

        <h4 class="media-heading">WorkZone</h4>
          WorkZone is a web app that tracks how much time a user wastes while studying. After the user manually inputs the sites that he or she finds unproductive, the app tracks these sites for a designated amount of time. After the time is up, the app displays a chart that represents the user's Internet activity, highlighting the time allotted to unproductive sites. Working with a four-person group for a Human Computer Interaction Class, I designed the general layout of our app. By doing so, I gained experience in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a one-page application. Although the class does not require us to implement its functionality, we hope to do so in the future. <a href="https://github.com/vcabales/EECS-330-Project">View here on Github.</a>

          Loren Ayala has always been cognizant of the challenges posed by her identity as a low-income and first-generation student. While her parents did not have the opportunity to graduate from high school in Mexico, the Northwestern University Senior has succeeded in her pursuit of a dual degree in civil and environmental engineering. Her pride for these accomplishments is well-deserved. However, growing up, Ayala felt that she was hiding crucial parts of her identity. She realized the importance of her background after joining the peer mentorship program Compass. <a href="mentoring/index.html" target="blank">Read the rest here.</a>

          As a conservative Southern Baptist minister, Pastor Danilo “Danny” Cortez never imagined that 60 percent of his congregation would one day leave his church due to his involvement with the LGBT community. Prior to becoming an LGBT activist to advance the rights of his gay son, the Filipino pastor firmly believed that homosexuality was a sin. <a href="article1.html" target="blank">Read the rest here.</a>

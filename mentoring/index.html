        <div class="featurette" id="compass">
            <p class="lead">Loren Ayala has always been cognizant of the challenges posed by her identity as a low-income and first-generation student. While her parents did not have the opportunity to graduate from high school in Mexico, the Northwestern University Senior has succeeded in her pursuit of a dual degree in civil and environmental engineering. Her pride for these accomplishments is well-deserved. However, growing up, <span class="soundcite" data-id="311341767" data-start="0" data-end="39840" data-plays="1">Ayala felt that she was hiding crucial parts of her identity</span>. She realized the importance of her background after joining the peer mentorship program Compass.</p>
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Empowerment found
                <span class="text-muted">through mentorship programs</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Since its inception in the fall of 2015, Compass has connected around 30 students each year who identify as low-income, first-generation, or both. Its year-long peer mentorship program fosters close relationships and a crucial support system among participating students. Freshmen apply to be mentees of trained Junior and Senior members when they begin the academic year. Their mentors help them navigate through the unique struggles they encounter throughout college.</p>

            <p class="lead">Ayala is one of these mentors, and she said that her experience as a Compass mentor has been eye-opening. Prior to the program’s inception, she felt that she did not have access to a platform to talk about her <span class="soundcite" data-id="311341996" data-start="0" data-end="37698" data-plays="1">experiences as a low-income and first-gen student</span>
            . From the discussions at Compass events, she has noticed the ways she had been silent about her identity, and she now feels empowered to be more outspoken. </p>

            <p class="lead">“Being part of [the Compass] community really opened my eyes to what it’s like to be an activist to pursue a transformation on campus that is really necessary,” Ayala said. </p>

            <p class="lead">In an article published by The Washington Post in 2015, a study claims that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/06/03/guilt-is-one-of-the-biggest-struggles-first-generation-college-students-face/?utm_term=.f54e32fa2fde" target="blank">first-generation students struggle with feelings of guilt </a>, citing that 69 percent of these students attend college to help their families. Ayala said that her role as a mentor in Compass addresses this concern by encouraging her mentees to pursue their intellectual passion rather than monetary wealth.</p>

            <p class="lead">“One thing that Compass is very cognizant about is that being first-gen and/or low-income puts this pressure on students to pursue a grandiose field, something that will be recognizable, that will bring them wealth,” Ayala said. “But part of what Compass does is help you realize you need to pursue what makes you happy… As mentors, we encourage students to explore outside of the mindset that they have.”</p>

            <p class="lead">As a result, Compass provides the resources low-income and first-gen students need in order to pursue their own vision of success. This caring relationship has fostered a sense of community and comfort amongst its members.</p>

            <p class="lead">In addition to establishing meaningful peer mentoring connections, Compass also guides its members through unique logistical struggles. Student Enrichment Services (SES) Director Kourtney Cockrell has organized events in which these students can meet professors who come from low-income, first-gen backgrounds. These events help students become more comfortable with expressing the circumstances of their situations, and Alaya said that she is thankful for the program’s impact.</p>

            <p class="lead">“It’s important to recognize that there are low income students on campus, that there are first-gen students,” Ayala said. “Because of those identities, there are a lot of unique challenges that this university is not equipped to deal with. The importance of Compass is really bringing that to light and guiding not only the institution, but also the student body and the faculty.”</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While Compass is a mentoring resource designed to navigate specific challenges of the Northwestern experience, similar programs exist for other students. The program Project SOAR, for example, connects disadvantaged youth from Evanston to older role models who they otherwise may not have met.</p>

            <p class="lead">Elise Roug, coordinator for the Mcgaw YMCA Project SOAR, relies heavily on Northwestern students to facilitate this one-on-one mentoring program with Evanston youth. Of all of the mentors involved with Project Soar, an overwhelming majority are Northwestern Students, roughly 65 out of 75. The YMCA has a partnership with Northwestern’s work-study department, allowing these students to fulfill their work-study requirements while giving back to the Evanston community. </p>

            </div>

            <p class="lead">“A majority of our referrals are from District 65 social workers,” Roug said about the mentees, who range from fourth grade students to high schoolers. “We also partner with some community organizations as well, like metropolitan family services and a grief center.” </p>

            <p class="lead">With an annual family survey given to the parents or guardians of the mentees, Roug sees firsthand the extent to which mentoring improves the social/emotional skills and academic efforts of the children. </p>

            <p class="lead">“We would see a rise in self-esteem with these kids, a rise in their grades and academic performance, and a rise in social engagement and feelings of being connected to an adult outside the family,” Roug said.</p>

            <p class="lead">Northwestern students participating in the program have also said that Project SOAR is a positive experience from a mentor’s perspective.</p>

            <p class="lead">Jason Chen, a Northwestern Senior majoring in environmental science, said that the program has helped him learn about the diversity of Evanston.</p>

            <p class="lead">“We are in our own little bubble in Northwestern,” Chen said. “Our vision of Evanston is this very privileged, often white socioeconomic area surrounding the campus. When in actuality, Evanston is pretty diverse.”</p>

            <p class="lead">Chen enjoys learning more about the Evanston community through his mentee, and he believes that he has made an impact on the seventh grader’s life. Overall, he has found his experience as a mentor to be rewarding.</p>

            <p class="lead">“It’s really great to connect with my mentee because he’s a great, great guy,” Chen said. “But he doesn’t really have a big male role model in his life. Even little bits of effort and time here and there can make a big effort in someone’s life and go a far way.”</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In addition to mentorship for members of disadvantaged communities, similar programs exist to help individuals achieve their career goals. Such programs empower their mentees by providing guidance and resources that answer their questions.</p>

            <p class="lead">Ben Hancock, senior associate director for Northwestern’s Network Alumni Mentorship program, is spearheading a brand new initiative that provides such a service. His mentoring program is designed to bolster the professional connections between Northwestern students and alumni.  </p>

            <p class="lead"> “We launched the pilot phase in January of 2016. It evolved very organically in the way that we structured it because we wanted to make sure that we were meeting alumni and student needs across the board,” Hancock said. </p>

            <p class="lead">The initiative, tailored specifically to Northwestern but modeled after Stanford University’s alumni mentoring platform, is uniquely customizable. Students and alumni are matched based on very specific criteria that each of them select, ranging from personal demographics to area of expertise. Services offered include resume reviews, experiential recommendations, and advice on pursuing graduate school. Mentoring tailored specifically for first-generation and low-income students is also offered.</p>

            <p class="lead">Hancock said that the turnout for the alumni mentorship program far exceeded his expectations. He said that approximately 4,000 alumni mentors and mentees have registered, along with 1,800 currently enrolled Northwestern students. However, he anticipated that only about 1,000 individuals would participate in the program within one year of its inception. </p>

            <p class="lead">Hancock believes that the program’s emphasis on providing a comfortable space has driven the program’s success.  </p>

            <p class="lead">“We all have questions regarding career-related goals. It’s good to know that there’s someone who’s willing to talk to them and guide them. It’s nice to have a friendly face,” Hancock said. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Despite the diverse range of peer mentorship programs that are offered at Northwestern alone, the programs are all tied by their ability to create a sense of community and comfortability. The close-knit relationships built by mentor-mentee relationships result in a tangible, beneficial impact. </p>

            <p class="lead">According to a 2014 study commissioned by MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership with support from AT&amp;T, <a href="http://www.mentoring.org/why-mentoring/mentoring-impact/" target="blank">young adults who have a mentor are 55 percent more likely to attend college</a>. A later study conducted by the same organization reported that <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Mentoring_at_the_crossroads_of_education,_business_and_community/$FILE/1501-1385340_Mentoring%20at%20the%20Crossroad_CV0116.pdf" target="blank">mentorship programs can help participants develop specific career skills and gain exposure to STEM topics. </a></p>

            <p class="lead">Damilola Arowolaju, a junior at Northwestern majoring in social policy, agreed that his time spent as a mentor for Compass has impacted him in a meaningful way. </p>

            <p class="lead"> “The stuff I do with the mentees and other mentors translates into other aspects of my life. It makes me more mindful of the things I do and the way I interact with people,” Arowolaju said.</p>
